# Taskify - A Modern To-Do List Web Application

Taskify is a beautifully designed, intuitive to-do list application built to bring clarity and organization to your daily tasks. This project showcases a complete front-end development workflow, from a compelling landing page to a feature-rich, interactive web app.

The core of Taskify is built with pure, vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating strong fundamentals in modern web technologies without reliance on external frameworks.

## About The Project

This project was developed as a comprehensive case study in modern front-end design and development. It consists of two main parts:

1.  **A Persuasive Landing Page:** Designed to tell a story and highlight the app's benefits, encouraging users to try the product.
2.  **A Functional Web Application:** The to-do list app itself, focusing on a clean, user-centric design and a satisfying user experience.

The entire application runs client-side and utilizes `localStorage` to persist user data, ensuring that your tasks are saved between sessions.

## Key Features

### Landing Page (`index.html`)
* **Hero Section:** A strong, clear value proposition to immediately grab the user's attention.
* **"Before & After" Showcase:** A unique storytelling component that visually demonstrates the app's benefits in transforming chaos into clarity.
* **Responsive Design:** A fully mobile-first layout that looks great on all devices.
* **Modern Aesthetics:** Built with a professional dark theme, subtle animations, and a clean layout to create a premium feel.

### To-Do App (`todo.html`)
* **Intuitive Task Management:** Easily add, complete, and delete tasks.
* **Sleek User Interface:** A refined and polished dark-mode interface that's easy on the eyes.
* **Custom UI Elements:** Satisfying custom-styled checkboxes and smooth animations for a superior user experience.
* **Smart Filtering:** Filter tasks by "All," "Active," and "Completed" states to stay focused.
* **Task Persistence:** Your to-do list is automatically saved to the browser's `localStorage`.
* **"Clear Completed" Functionality:** A dedicated button to easily clear all finished tasks and reduce clutter.
* **Dynamic UI Updates:** The task count and "empty state" message update in real-time.

## Technologies Used

This project is a testament to the power of core web technologies, built with:

* **HTML5:** For semantic and accessible structure.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, including custom properties (variables), Flexbox, Grid, and keyframe animations.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all application logic, DOM manipulation, event handling, and interaction with `localStorage`.

No external frameworks or libraries were used for the core application logic, demonstrating strong foundational skills.
